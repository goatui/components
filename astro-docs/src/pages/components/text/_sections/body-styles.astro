  <goat-text type='body'>
    With a slightly taller line height than body-compact-01, this body style is used in productive layouts for long
    paragraphs with more than four lines. Use also for longer body copy in components such as accordion or structured
    list. It is always left-aligned. Body-long-01 can also be used for productive moments within expressive experiences.
